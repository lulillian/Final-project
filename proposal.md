# 1. The Big Idea
I plan to create a program that has to do with finance. As someone who is passionate about it, I plan to have a website that takes any stock ticker input, and returns  the information about the stock, and whether it is a buy, sell, or hold. That is my minimally viable product. My stretch goal is to hopefully have a program where it can text or email an individual about a certain stock and if the price dropped to a certain price inputted. 
# 2. Learning Objectives
I have several learning goals that I hope to acheive at the end of this project. I hope to build a web application that is professional enough to be added to my resume and talked about in interviews. I also want to strenght my API knowledge and see how far I can achieve knowning the power and information APIs give me.
# 3. Implementation Plan
I plan to use the **Yahoo Finance Library** to access all the financial information.
# 4 Project Schedule
**Week 1**: Learn the basics of the Finance Library, and start pulling stock data
**Week 2**: Start on the forumlas and functions that would consider a stock a buy or sell or hold. Start working on the website interface.
**Week 3** Designing the html interface and using the flask to excecute the web page. 
# 5. Collaboration Plan
I am working by myself.
# 6. Risks and Limitations
I think the most significant threat might be accuracy of my formulas and whether a stock is a buy/sell/hold, especially during such an economy. For the stretch goal, I have never implemented a system where I can send messages or email ourside of the server. This is a feature I may need to look into, if I could implement it at all.
# 7. Additional Course Content
I think we need more practice on flask. I would also like to learn tools that can help me send informastion from the program to a phone number or email. Lastly, I think if we learned how to draw charts in python, it would helpful!
