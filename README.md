# Big Idea/Goal/Why did we do this?

Portfolio Pro is a website that can help users that are unfamiliar with stocks learn about companies they are interested in researching more. User can input a ticker and the website will return information regarding the company including its openning and closing price, price change, and book value price per share. The user then has the choice to add the stock to their portfolio or look up another stock instead. ![Tesla Example](https://github.com/lulillian/Final-project/blob/main/tesla_ex.PNG) 



# User Instructions

The website is very simple to use. User will be brought to the homepage where they can start looking up the tickers that interest them. Then they will be brought to a page with all the information regarding the company and whether or not they would like to add it to their portfolio with one click of a button.
